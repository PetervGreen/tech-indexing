# MDITA

Click "raw" to compare actual text of this file to visible rendered version. That is "markdown".

## Pandoc Scholar

Will draft working papers and journal articles using this:

https://pandoc-scholar.github.io

Download and study. Will take a while.

## Github Flavoured Markdown - GFM

Meanwhile will start using small single topic files that can later be enhanced and combined using LwDITA map or just combined manually.

Mainly just p1 of this 2 page cheatsheet for GFM:

https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf

Useful explanation here with links for more at end:

https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/

Gitlab flavour is similar and we may end up using some of its extended features. More detail here:

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html

Full spec (132 pp) for GFM is referenced by LwDITA but not needed.

https://github.github.com/gfm/

Will eventually use the "Extended MDITA" of Appendix A (1-3), pp25-30 in:

http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/LwDITA/v1.0/cn02/LwDITA-v1.0-cn02.html

This includes GFM Tables plus definition list and footnotes from:

https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/

May eventually add more fancy markup for interactive exploratory explanations eg:

https://idyll-lang.org

Gollum wiki supports such extensions (and is used at Gitlab)

## Map

Possibly just use wiki to define maps in same project repository.

### 5.3.3 Example of an MDITA map

An MDITA map is authored in Markdown. The following example uses MDITA core-profile syntax
to produce a map with a title, and an unordered list (itself containing a nested, unordered list) of
titles for topics and their associated file names.
