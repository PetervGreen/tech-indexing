See two pdfs from MIT for quick guide.

Standalone v5 on all PC platforms and online, with connector for save to Zotero from main browsers - Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

No special advantage with Firefox. Chrome or Safari just as good.

Some mobile support (via online):

Use bookmarklet to save references from browser to online Zotero when no connector to a desktop Zotero available eg for Tablet or phone.
