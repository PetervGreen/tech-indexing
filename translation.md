# Translation

Not a high priority but could become relevant, especially for collecting sources in particular relevant languages such as Russian, German, French, Japanese and Chinese.

Machine translation is becoming increasingly useful and could be used as an interim measure, perhaps as a way to find translators who can revise and improve the interim versions.

Use of DITA with ingestion of all texts to an XML database should be sufficient to ensure no unnecessary costs are incurred by not considering translation issues now.

This is a supplementary reason for using DITA.

Some software:

## Glossaries and Terminology

In addition a focus on thorough preparations of domain glossaries could be helpful for translation.

Consider using translation related standards such as GlossML and TBX as well the use of formal Ontology software and UML informaton models for domain modeling.

## Simplified English

Finally, DITA could help with preparing Simplified English versions of english materials that could result in better machine translations to other translations, in conjunction with multilingual glossaries of special terms.

There are software tools for checking use of some forms of Simplified English and adequacy of the related glossaries.
