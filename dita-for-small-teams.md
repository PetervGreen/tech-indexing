# DITA For Small Teams

This project appears to be exactly what I have been looking for.

But no updates since 2017?

Even suggests (and provides a docker configuration ready to go) for 
the same software stack I had in mind:

- GitLab with CI/CD
- BaseX with XQuery XML database
- oXygen XML Editor
- DT-OT

Supports my basic assumption:

"These are all features that are offered by commercial content management systems to one degree or another. Commercial 
CMS systems can offer a lot of value but they also represent a significant monetary and time investment, an investment that 
many teams either simply cannot make or do not have budget for early in the process of adopting DITA.

Most, if not all, of these facilities—distributed access, version management, production automation, tool integration, and 
even link management—can be provided by free or low-cost tools and services at the cost of some time spent setting up and 
maintaining the system. This makes it possible for even the smallest writing team to get the benefit of sophisticated, 
DITA-aware content management, with a very small initial investment of time and money. Most of the money spent will be on 
authoring tool licenses and most of the time spent is just getting the necessary tools and services in place: none of them 
are difficult to acquire, install, or configure."


Also claims:

"In most cases it should be possible, following the guidelines provided here, to set up a working collaborative DITA 
authoring and production environment in just a few hours.

The D4ST project’s Docker-based solution makes it about as easy as it can be to provision and use the D4ST approach. 
Docker makes it possible to package disparate tools together in a convenience but flexible way and manage them as a 
logical unit. Because each tool or supporting component is managed as a separate Docker container it is relatively 
easy to adapt the set of tools and configuration details to suit your specific needs. The same Docker containers 
can be run on a single personal machine, on a shared server machine within an enterprise, or in a hosted environment 
such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure with a minimum of effort."

This is encouraging but refers to a small enterprise team preparing technical documentation, who presumably have 
access to IT skills and/or support.

Also additional work will be required for our immediate need to integrate with Zotero and JATS and eventually for 
exploratory animations. But essentially this confirms feasability.
